# Machine-learning_model-forecasting

Project to create model used for a short-term temperature forecast

- Build a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality
- Plot and inspect the different components of a time series
- Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model
- Compare the statistical output of different AR models
- Test the remainder for stationarity
